# Sylvester’s Crib – WinForms Simulation

Sylvester’s Crib is a C# WinForms simulation that models basic pet care,
including feeding, hydration, cleanliness, and happiness.

The simulation uses progress bars and animations to provide visual
feedback based on user interaction.

AI tools were used only for brainstorming ideas and generating visual
assets. All application logic and code were written and implemented by me.
